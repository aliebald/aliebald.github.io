# Social Games

Web app that can be used to collect and find online social games.
Games have an image for quick recognition, player count limits and tags to map various attributes.

It enables groups of users to quickly find games to play online without the need for long searches or
comparisons of each person's game libraries.
If a game is not in the collection, users can add it themselves after signing in and receiving the necessary authorization.

# Usage

Simply open [social-games.liebald.dev/games](https://social-games.liebald.dev/games), enter the desired player count,
adjust selected tags if desired and inspect the results.

Further instructions on how to contribute games and tags to the collection can be found at
[social-games.liebald.dev](https://social-games.liebald.dev).

# Tech Stack

The app's frontend was build based on the atomic design principles using Next.js and Mantine.
For data storage, Firebase is used. While most of the Firebase logic can reside in the frontend,
more sensitive interactions are build using Next.js server actions.

## Administration

The app provides a small build in administration panel.
This panel enables administrators to list registered users and manage their roles within the app.
It also provides a simple way for backups with an export and import function, which exports/imports
the whole database and uploaded images in the form of a zip archive.
