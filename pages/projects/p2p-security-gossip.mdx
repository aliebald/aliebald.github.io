# Background

In the winter semester of 2021/22 I participated in the Peer-to-Peer-Systems and Security course at Technical
University of Munich. As part of this course, teams of two implemented modules for a anonymous and unobservable VoIP
application using a self designed P2P architecture. A selection of possible modules was provided and together with
my team partner, we decided to implement Gossip.

# Gossip

Gossip was the module responsible for spreading information in the network. Other modules based their functionality
on Gossip (or a provided mockup). For example, if a user goes online, Gossip is responsible for spreading the
information that this user is now online.

# Design &amp; Development

All design decisions and the development process were documented in a final document:
_P2P Gossip Protocol - An Implementation discussing Architectural and Security Standpoints_.
This document ([link](https://github.com/aliebald/p2psec-gossip/blob/master/docs/documentation.pdf))
as well as the code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/aliebald/aliebald.github.io/issues).

# Control Flow

As a small sneak-peek at the above-mentioned document, the following flowchart shows the program flow. It starts
when the module is initiated and runs until a keyboard interrupt is detected.
